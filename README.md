Welcome to the repository containing the code used in my bachelors thesis!

Data_analyse_condensatieplaat was used for loading all data from the sensors and converting to timestamped libraries and to plot from the libraries

Emissivity_atmosphere is a project that investigated the theoretical justification of the emissivity as function of dewpoint

Radiationformulas is the code used to linearize the stefan-boltzmann equation

Delta_T_for condens is a sort of 'final' theoretical file where i investigate the temperature differences and condensation outputs with the functions created with Emissivity_atmosphere and radiationformulas

note that most of this code has been used exploratively, which makes it a little chaotic. Please feel free to contact me about any questions!
